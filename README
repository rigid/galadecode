Commandline utility to decode raw GALA signal from pipe

Use a soundcard to capture the raw GALA/SVC/SCV squarewave
signal (e.g. using the "rec" tool from http://sox.sourceforge.net)
and then pipe to galadecode.

I used schematic/gala-to-audio.png and it works for me. USE IT AT OWN RISK!
I'm not reliable for your toasted soundcard!

If you don't use 16 bit signed integer PCM format at 48kHz, you have to edit
the source.

Example: 

rec -c1 -r48000 -d - | galadecode -i 500 -

This will output the current speed on stdout every 0.5 seconds.
