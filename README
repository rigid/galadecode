Commandline utility to decode raw GALA signal from pipe

Use a soundcard do capture the raw GALA/SVC/SCV squarewave
signal (e.g. using the "rec" tool from http://sox.sourceforge.net/
and then pipe to galadecode.

If you don't used 16 bit signed integer PCM format at 48kHz, you have to edit
the source.

Example: rec -c1 -d - | galadecode -
